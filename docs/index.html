                            looking to make a

                            people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
                            it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                            shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                            Since completing the course,
                            I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can
                    help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
                    can only say
                    wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
                    very hands-on and I
                    never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It
                    took my learning to
                    the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. ”
